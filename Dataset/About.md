# About This Project

## Overview

The **Diabetes Predictor** project leverages machine learning to predict diabetes outcomes based on the **Custom Diabetes Dataset**.The project aims to develop a predictive model using various medical features to classify whether a patient has diabetes.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following columns:

- **Pregnancies**: Number of times the patient has been pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration after 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin level (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg / (height in m)^2)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function
- **Age**: Age of the patient (years)
- **Outcome**: Class variable indicating diabetes presence (0 or 1); 268 out of 768 samples are positive for diabetes

The dataset provides a comprehensive set of medical predictor variables, allowing for robust analysis and model development.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts diabetes based on the provided features. The model can be used for early diagnosis and better management of diabetes by analyzing patient medical data.
